      <h6 class="section-title">Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h6>

      <h6 class="section-title">Types of Data Collected</h6>

      <h6 class="section-title">Personal Data</h6>
      <p>While using our Service, we may ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information, which may include, but is not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Company Name</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>GST Details</li>
        <li>PAN Card Details</li>
        <li>Bank Account details</li>
        <li>Phone number</li>
        <li>Address, State, Postal code, City</li>
      </ul>

      <h6 class="section-title">Usage Data</h6>
      <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service. This may include information such as your device's IP address, browser type, browser version, pages of our Service you visit, time and date of your visit, time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. When accessing the Service via a mobile device, we may collect information such as the location of your device, contacts, gallery, relevant applications, device type, unique device ID, IP address, mobile operating system, and browser type.</p>

      <h6 class="section-title">API Based Tokens for Secure User Authentication</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Authentication establishes the identity of the user and verifies that the user is who (or what) it says it is. Authentication protects your resources by denying access to unauthenticated users.</li>
        <li>Authentication gives each user a distinct identity, protecting your data and theirs. Applications that require users to create an account give each user a unique profile, which is what determines the data shown to the user. For example, PayPal requires users to sign in before displaying their account balance and transactions.</li>
      </ul>
